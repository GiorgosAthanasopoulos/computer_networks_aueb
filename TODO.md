- Small analysis of the implementation

- Small description of the source files, how they are related, how they are compiled and the names of the corresponding output files.

- Application specific:
    - How to run client,server,etc.
    - Problems that you encountered while developing the solution
 
- Screenshots for:
    - successful connection to server
    - successful modification and saving of a profile on the server from a specific client
    - successful file lock
    - unsuccessful file lock
    - unsuccessful file lock and modification from different client
    - successful file unlock and modification from other client
    - profile and others files debug print after posting
    - follow-back
    - follow
    - deny
    - post comment only on the posting client
    - post comment on all of the posting client's followers
    - unfollow

    - debug print of successful packate receival
    - debug print of unsuccessful packate receival
    - debug print of unsuccessful packate retransmission
    - debug print of successful image and text receival
    - debug messages for all of the above scenarios

- Review of the project subject. 
    - which parts were the hardest to implement,
    - what made your life easier code-wise,
    - different methods that you considered but didn't end up using in the final product

- Submit (deadline: 7/5/25) using filename: 19.zip (group id)
